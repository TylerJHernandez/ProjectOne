<h1> hello html, my old enemy </h1>
<p>Confounds are things that could undermine your ability to draw casual inference, such as a placebo effect (ex telling
    someone they’re taking a happy pill might make them feel happy even if they aren’t experiencing it from the pill!)
    participant demand and experimenters expectations can also effect the experiment so in order to ensure neutral
    conditions is to do a double blind procedure (ex giving participants a fake and a happy pill so they don’t know
    which one they’re taking and not telling the researcher which ones they took until after the procedures done to
    ensure unbiased opinions from everyone involved.
