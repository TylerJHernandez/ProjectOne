<p>Confounds are things that could undermine your ability to draw casual inference, such as a placebo effect (ex telling someone they’re taking a happy pill might make them feel happy even if they aren’t experiencing it from the pill!) participant demand and experimenters expectations can also effect the experiment so in order to ensure neutral conditions is to do a double blind procedure (ex giving participants a fake and a happy pill so they don’t know which one they’re taking and not telling the researcher which ones they took until after the procedures done to ensure unbiased opinions from everyone involved.
